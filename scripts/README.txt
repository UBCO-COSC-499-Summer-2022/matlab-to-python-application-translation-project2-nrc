These batch are quick shortcuts for windows users to get up and running quick.

The only pre-requestite is a compatible version of Python must be installed
and be in the user's PATH environment variable.

Only one of the three install scripts must be run:

install-user.bat   : installs for current user only
install-global.bat : installs for all windows users, but may require admin priviledges
install-here.bat   : installs a symbolic link to the current location of the project folder,
rather than copying files for installation. Use this only if you intend to modify the python files.
This will break and require a reinstall if you move project folder.
