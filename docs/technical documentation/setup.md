# Setup

## Development Environment Setup
Follow the steps in the [README](../../README.md).

**Development Environment:**
Enter the Poetry virtual shell during every development session to use supporting libraries, lint, and test.

## Development Environment Alternative
Another, easier way to develop this software is to do the following:

1. After installing the software to your machine, open the main folder with all the code in VS Code.
   - See install instructions in the [README](../../README.md).
2. Edit the files in VS code to make changes.
3. Run the specific software you want by running the `main.py` file in the software folder with Python.
    - You can do this by right clicking on the `main.py` file and click with Python.
4. OR run the software you want by clicking **Run** then **Start Debugging** in VS Code. This way, you can add breakpoints in the code during development. Change the software that runs by clicking on the **blue bar** at the bottom of your VS Code window and choose the software to run.


## Setup considerations
These software uses tools that developers need to download on their machine. If you are a developer, you must verify that your machine has permission to download the various tools required. If you are unsure whether your machine has permission, please contact your IT support service.
