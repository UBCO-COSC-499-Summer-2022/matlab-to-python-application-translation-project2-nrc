## Getting started - Pipenv
To start run command, this works to install all dependencies:
```
 pipenv install
 ```

Then run:
```
pipenv shell
```
```
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run all your scripts with:
```
python script_name.py
```

After you're done programming run linter:
```
flake8 script_name.py
```
